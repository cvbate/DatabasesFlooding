# Group 4 – Flood Risk Assessment

Grace, Ruthanne, & Clio
  
## OBJECTIVES

Assess flood risk in a coastal city by analyzing topography, historical flood events, and current flood defenses. 
The final output should be a comprehensive report that includes a methodology section, descriptions of the 
database schema and spatial queries used, and an analysis of the findings. Maps and visualizations created 
with QGIS should be used to illustrate historical land use change.

## ASSIGNMENTS

Complete the following assignments. Deliverables will include pushing to your public GitHub and updating the
README at every step. 
Groups will decide whether one person will control the repository with the other two members cloning to 
their own profiles, or whether all members will publish duplicate repositories directly from their own machine.

### Group 2 Assignment 1 – Data Acquisition, Processing, & Database Setup

1. Find and Process Geospatial Data

- Collect data on elevation, historical flood events, and flood defense structures (e.g., levees, walls).

- Ensure the data includes spatial attributes.

1. Set Up Database Schema

- Design a schema to represent topography, flood events, and flood defenses.

- Include attributes such as elevation, flood date, severity, defense type, and location.

1. Pre-process the data in QGIS

- Process the data in QGIS to align different datasets temporally and spatially.

### Group 2 Assignment 2 – Import Spatial Data & Normalize Tables

Import it into PostgreSQL tables/schema created in Assignment 1.
Normalize your tables (1NF up to possibly 4NF, depending on your data).

### Group 2 Assignment 3 - Spatial Queries & Presentation

Analyze the data to identify:
• High-risk areas based on elevation and historical events.
• Effectiveness of existing flood defenses.
• Areas in need of additional flood defenses.
